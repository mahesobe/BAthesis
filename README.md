This repository contains all MATLAB scripts which were used for preprocessing and the originals which were provided, including resources needed to run them. Additionally, scripts which were written for visualization can also be found here, as well as the csv files containing electrode rejection information. 

The EEG data was not shared here, but can be found by NBP members on store in the accompanying project folder.
